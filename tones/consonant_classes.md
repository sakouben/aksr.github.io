# Consonant classes

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>), rather than a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/). The phonemic value of a consonant has no influence on tone; only its orthographic representation does.*

The three consonant classes are `high`, `middle`, and `low`. It is more useful to think of this not as a three-way split, but rather as a dichotomy between `high` and `low`, with `middle`-class consonants existing outside of the two-way split. The `middle`-class consonants are less numerous than the other two, but function much more straightforwardly. We will therefore begin with them.

## Middle-class consonants  

### `live` syllables

In `live` syllables and without any tone-modifying <span id="thai-text">ห</span> or <span id="thai-text">อ</span> preceding the syllable initial, `middle`-class consonants produce the following tones:

<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` or `short` vowel) + `middle`-class consonant </b>

| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๊ </span>|<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๋ </span>|
|:--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">กา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก้า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก๊า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก๋า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kā:/** | **/kà:/** | **/kâ:/** | **/ká:/** | **/kǎ:/** | 
| Tone | middle | low | falling | high | rising |

<br>

### `dead` syllables

In `dead` syllables, `middle`-class consonants cannot take any tone mark. In such cases, regardless of whether the vowel is `long` or `short`, the tone of the syllable will be low:

> <span id="thai-text">กะ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/kàʔ/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to estimate*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">กัด</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/kàt/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to bite*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">จาก</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/jà:k/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(prep., *from*)

<br>

***NB*** In rare cases `middle`-class `dead` syllables can take the third tone mark `๊`. This give it the high tone. It occurs very frequently in loans, in particular English loans as well as in Thai-accented English, though transcriptions of these (such as in foreign names) often leave out the tone mark.

> <span id="thai-text">โจ๊ก</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/jó:k/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *congee*, from Cantonese or Hakka 粥)
> 
> <span id="thai-text">ตุ๊ก(ตา)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/túk/(/kà.tā:/)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *doll*, possibly from Old Khmer តុក្តរ៑ / តុក្តរ)

## High- and low-class consonants  

### `live` syllables

In contrast, `high`- and `low`-class consonants can only take the first and second tone marks <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span> and <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>, as well as no mark.  For this reason, each consonant in the `high` class is only able to be used to indicate three out of the five tones.


<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` vowel) + `high`-class consonant </b>

| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| 
|:--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ข่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ข้า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kʰǎ:/** | **/kʰà:/** | **/kʰâ:/** |
| Tone | rising | low | falling |

<br>

Likewise, each `low`-class consonant can only be used, alone and in conjunction with the tone marks, to produce a total of three tones.

<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` vowel) + `low`-class consonant </b>

| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| 
|:--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">คา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ค่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ค้า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kʰā:/** | **/kʰâ:/** | **/kʰá:/** |
| Tone | middle | falling | high |

<br>

The above example is illustrated with the `high`-`low` pair <span id="thai-text">ข/ค</span>. Notice how, together, they are able to produce all five distinct tones, albeit in a manner more convoluted than with the `middle`-class consonants.

<b style="text-align:right"> Licit tones in `live` syllables (`long` vowel), orthographic representations </b>

| Tone | middle | low | falling | high | rising |
|:--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **/k/**: `middle`-class  | กา | ก่า | ก้า | ก๊า | ก๋า |
|
| **/kʰ/**: `low`-class | คา | | ค่า |ค้า  ||
| **/kʰ/**: `high`-class | | ข่า | ข้า| | ขา |

<br>

Notice how there is overlap in the falling tone between the `low`-class consonant-tone mark 1 and the `high`-class consonant-tone mark 2 combinations. This can be a frequent source of spelling errors.


***NB*** The sounds represented by the `middle`-class consonants never overlap with those represented by the `high` and `low`-class consonants. For example, **/d/** is represented only by <span id="thai-text">ด</span> and <span id="thai-text">ฎ</span>, which are both `middle`-class consonants. **/s/** is represented by <span id="thai-text">ส</span>, <span id="thai-text">ศ</span>, <span id="thai-text">ษ</span>, and <span id="thai-text">ซ</span>; the first three are `high`-class consonants, while the last is a `low`-class consonant.

### `dead` syllables

In `dead` syllables, `low`- and `high`-class consonants cannot take any tone markers. Since `dead` syllables only permit the low and high tones this is not an issue, though due to naming conventions it is somewhat confusing; `low`-class consonants in `dead` syllables produce the high tone, while `high`-class consonants in `dead` syllables produce the low tone with `short` vowel nuclei.


<b style="text-align:right"> `dead` syllable (`short` vowel) + `low`-/`high`-class consonant </b>

| Consonant class | `low` | `high` |
|:--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขะ</span> | <span id="thai-text">คะ</span> | 
| Pronunciation | **/kʰàʔ/** | **/kʰáʔ/** | 
| Tone | low | high | 

<br>

Tone determination is similar with `long` vowels. `low`-class consonants act the same, producing a low tone, but `high`-class consonants instead yield a falling tone:

<b style="text-align:right"> `dead` syllable (`long` vowel) + `low`-/`high`-class consonant </b>

| Consonant class | `low` | `high` |
|:--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขาด</span> | <span id="thai-text">คาด</span> | 
| Pronunciation | **/kʰà:t/** | **/kʰâ:t/** | 
| Tone | low | falling |
