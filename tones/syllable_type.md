# Syllable type

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/), rather than an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>).*

"Syllable type" refers to the type of consonant in the syllable final. Thai has a very restricted set of sounds that can be used as syllable finals; these are /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/, /w/, and /u/. These can be grouped like so:

<br>

#### Syllable codas

|Manner of articulation| Finals |
|:--|:--|
| Nasal | /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ |
| Plosive | /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/ |
| Approximant | /w/, /u/ |

Syllables with nasal and approximant finals are referred to as `live` syllables, whereas plosive-final syllables are termed `dead` syllables.

Importantly, `dead` syllables permit only a subset of the tones available to `live` syllables.
