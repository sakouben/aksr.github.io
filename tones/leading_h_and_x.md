## Leading <span id="thai-text">ห and อ </span>

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/), rather than an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>).*

Certain initials are only represented in the orthography with a `low`-class consonant. Take for example **/m/**, which has only one letter associated with it: <span id="thai-text">ม</span>. We can draw out the associated tone table
