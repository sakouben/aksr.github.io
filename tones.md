# Tones

{:toc}

Thai has five phonemic tones. They are, however, not represented straightforwardly in the orthography; there is no tone marker which can immediately tell the reader what tone the syllable it governs is meant to be pronounced with. The tone markers that do exist produce different tones depending on context. 

Take as an example the first tone mark <span id="thai-text">ไม้เอก</span> /má:i è:k/, which looks like a small vertical dash above the consonant<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>. In certain contexts, it produces a falling tone,

> <span id="thai-text">ย่า</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/yâ:/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *paternal grandmother*) 

and in others a low tone,

> <span id="thai-text">ป่า</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/pà:/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *forest*)

<br>
<br>
There are four factors which affect the tone of the syllable, aside from the tone marks (<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>, <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>, <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๊ </span>, <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๋ </span>). They are:


1. Syllable type (`live`, `dead`)
2. Vowel length (`long`, `short`)
3. Consonant class (`high`, `middle`, `low`)
4. The presence or absence of the letters <span id="thai-text">ห</span> or <span id="thai-text">อ</span> before the syllable initial.


Each of these factors will be treated in order.

## Syllable type

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/), rather than an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>).*

"Syllable type" refers to the type of consonant in the syllable final. Thai has a very restricted set of sounds that can be used as syllable finals; these are /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/, /w/, and /u/. These can be grouped like so:

|Manner of articulation| Finals |
|:--|:--|
| Nasal | /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ |
| Plosive | /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/ |
| Approximant | /w/, /u/ |

Syllables with nasal and approximant finals are referred to as `live` syllables, whereas plosive-final syllables are termed `dead` syllables.

Importantly, `dead` syllables permit only a subset of the tones available to `live` syllables.

#### Licit tones in `live` and `dead` syllables

| Tone | `live` | `dead` |
|:--|:--:|:--:|
| Middle | ◯ | ╳ |
| Low | ◯ | ◯ |
| Falling | ◯ | ╳ |
| High | ◯ | ◯ |
| Rising | ◯ | ╳ |


## Vowel length

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/), rather than an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>).*

Thai contrasts short and long vowels in its syllabic nuclei. 

For the purposes of tone determination, syllables with short vowels are analysed, without exception, as always having a final consonant. If no consonant is ostensibly present in the final, such as may seem to be the case with words such as "<span id="thai-text">กะ</span>", comprised of ⟨<span id="thai-text">ก</span>⟩ /k/ and ⟨<span id="thai-text">ะ</span>⟩ /a/, a glottal stop /ʔ/ is the final.

> <span id="thai-text">ตำ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/tām/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to beat*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">เละ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/lé(+ʔ)/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(adj., *messy*)

Syllables with long vowels, in contrast, are allowed null codas.

> <span id="thai-text">ยา</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/yā:/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *medicine*)

Vowel length only affects tone in `dead` syllables; in `live` syllables,  short-vowel and long-vowel versions of the same orthographic syllable are pronounced with the same tone.

Compare `dead` syllables:
> <span id="thai-text">ราบ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/râ:p/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(adj., *smooth*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">รับ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/ráp/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to receive*)

while `live` syllables:
> <span id="thai-text">รัง</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/rāŋ/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *nest*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">ราง</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/rā:ŋ/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *rails*)


## Consonant classes

*In this section, the word 'consonant' in isolation refers to an orthographic consonant (a letter representing a consonant, such as <span id="thai-text">ม</span> or <span id="thai-text">ก</span>), rather than a phonemic consonant (such as /m/ or /k/). The phonemic value of a consonant has no influence on tone; only its orthographic representation does.*

The three consonant classes are `high`, `middle`, and `low`. It is more useful to think of this not as a three-way split, but rather as a dichotomy between `high` and `low`, with `middle`-class consonants existing outside of the two-way split. The `middle`-class consonants are less numerous than the other two, but function much more straightforwardly. We will therefore begin with them.

### Middle-class consonants  

#### `live` syllables

In `live` syllables and without any tone-modifying <span id="thai-text">ห</span> or <span id="thai-text">อ</span> preceding the syllable initial, `middle`-class consonants produce the following tones:

<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` or `short` vowel) + `middle`-class consonant </b>

| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๊ </span>|<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ๋ </span>|
|:--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">กา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก้า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก๊า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ก๋า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kā:/** | **/kà:/** | **/kâ:/** | **/ká:/** | **/kǎ:/** | 
| Tone | middle | low | falling | high | rising |

<br>

#### `dead` syllables

In `dead` syllables, `middle`-class consonants cannot take any tone mark. In such cases, regardless of whether the vowel is `long` or `short`, the tone of the syllable will be low:

> <span id="thai-text">กะ</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/kàʔ/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to estimate*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">กัด</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/kàt/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v., *to bite*)
>
> <span id="thai-text">จาก</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/jà:k/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(prep., *from*)

<br>

***NB*** In rare cases `middle`-class `dead` syllables can take the third tone mark `๊`. This give it the high tone. It occurs very frequently in loans, in particular English loans as well as in Thai-accented English, though transcriptions of these (such as in foreign names) often leave out the tone mark.

> <span id="thai-text">โจ๊ก</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/jó:k/**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *congee*, from Cantonese or Hakka 粥)
> 
> <span id="thai-text">ตุ๊ก(ตา)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**/túk/(/kà.tā:/)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n., *doll*, possibly from Old Khmer តុក្តរ៑ / តុក្តរ)


### High- and low-class consonants  

#### `live` syllables

In contrast, `high`- and `low`-class consonants can only take the first and second tone marks <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span> and <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>, as well as no mark.  For this reason, each consonant in the `high` class is only able to be used to indicate three out of the five tones.


<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` vowel) + `high`-class consonant </b>

| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| 
|:--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ข่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ข้า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kʰǎ:/** | **/kʰà:/** | **/kʰâ:/** |
| Tone | rising | low | falling |

<br>

Likewise, each `low`-class consonant can only be used, alone and in conjunction with the tone marks, to produce a total of three tones.

<b style="text-align:right"> `live` syllable (`long` vowel) + `low`-class consonant </b>
| Tone mark | (null) |<span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ่ </span>| <span id="invisible">x</span><span id="diacritic-presentation"> ้ </span>| 
|:--|--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">คา</span> | <span id="thai-text">ค่า</span> | <span id="thai-text">ค้า</span> |
| Pronunciation | **/kʰā:/** | **/kʰâ:/** | **/kʰá:/** |
| Tone | middle | falling | high |

<br>

The above example is illustrated with the `high`-`low` pair <span id="thai-text">ข/ค</span>. Notice how, together, they are able to produce all five distinct tones, albeit in a manner more convoluted than with the `middle`-class consonants.

<b style="text-align:right"> Licit tones in `live` syllables (`long` vowel), orthographic representations </b>

| Tone | middle | low | falling | high | rising |
|:--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **/k/**: `middle`-class  | กา | ก่า | ก้า | ก๊า | ก๋า |
|
| **/kʰ/**: `low`-class | คา | | ค่า |ค้า  ||
| **/kʰ/**: `high`-class | | ข่า | ข้า| | ขา |

<br>

Notice how there is overlap in the falling tone between the `low`-class consonant-tone mark 1 and the `high`-class consonant-tone mark 2 combinations. This can be a frequent source of spelling errors.


***NB*** The sounds represented by the `middle`-class consonants never overlap with those represented by the `high` and `low`-class consonants. For example, **/d/** is represented only by <span id="thai-text">ด</span> and <span id="thai-text">ฎ</span>, which are both `middle`-class consonants. **/s/** is represented by <span id="thai-text">ส</span>, <span id="thai-text">ศ</span>, <span id="thai-text">ษ</span>, and <span id="thai-text">ซ</span>; the first three are `high`-class consonants, while the last is a `low`-class consonant.

#### `dead` syllables

In `dead` syllables, `low`- and `high`-class consonants cannot take any tone markers. Since `dead` syllables only permit the low and high tones this is not an issue, though due to naming conventions it is somewhat confusing; `low`-class consonants in `dead` syllables produce the high tone, while `high`-class consonants in `dead` syllables produce the low tone with `short` vowel nuclei.


<b style="text-align:right"> `dead` syllable (`short` vowel) + `low`-/`high`-class consonant </b>
| Consonant class | `low` | `high` |
|:--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขะ</span> | <span id="thai-text">คะ</span> | 
| Pronunciation | **/kʰàʔ/** | **/kʰáʔ/** | 
| Tone | low | high | 

<br>

Tone determination is similar with `long` vowels. `low`-class consonants act the same, producing a low tone, but `high`-class consonants instead yield a falling tone:

<b style="text-align:right"> `dead` syllable (`long` vowel) + `low`-/`high`-class consonant </b>
| Consonant class | `low` | `high` |
|:--|--|--|
| Syllable | <span id="thai-text">ขาด</span> | <span id="thai-text">คาด</span> | 
| Pronunciation | **/kʰà:t/** | **/kʰâ:t/** | 
| Tone | low | falling |
